# Trash Sort Service

**Project Overview**

Trash Sort Service is a lightweight Spring Boot application that assists users—especially students and newcomers—in
Germany to sort their waste correctly. It exposes a simple REST API to:

- Define various **container types** (glass, paper, plastic, etc.)
- Associate **waste items** with the appropriate container
- Search items by name and retrieve the correct disposal bin
- Perform full CRUD operations on containers and items

This service runs entirely in-memory (no database), making it perfect for demonstration, prototyping, and educational
projects. It preloads sample data on startup and resets on every application restart.

## Features

* In-memory CRUD for **Containers** and **Items**
* REST API with endpoints for creating, reading, updating, deleting, and searching
* Swagger UI documentation via Springdoc OpenAPI
* Preloaded sample data on application startup
